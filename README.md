# CPSB1300-FinalProject
Final Project for CSPB 1300 at CU Boulder

This project was the culmination of our C++ learning in the CSPB 1300 course at CU Boulder.

Our goal was to implement 10 functions of image manipulation with the sample code given, and then create a UI for the user to give commands through.

This was a cool project and I feel it was a great learning experience in my programming journey!
